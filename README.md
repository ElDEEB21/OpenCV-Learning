# OpenCV Learning Journey 📸🤖

Welcome to my OpenCV learning repository! This repo documents my journey learning computer vision with OpenCV, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal learning log and practice space for OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). I'm documenting my progress, code examples, and projects as I work through various tutorials and resources.

## Learning Resources

### Primary Resource
🎯 **Main Tutorial Series**: [OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?si=sGK615i9zXabRJ4k)
- **Source**: FreeCodeCamp
- **Language**: Python
- **Duration**: Comprehensive tutorial series

### Additional Resources
📚 I'll be adding more learning resources as I progress:
- Official OpenCV Documentation
- Computer Vision books and papers
- Other online tutorials and courses
- Practice projects and challenges

## Repository Structure

```
📁 OpenCV-Learning/
├── 📄 *.py               # Python practice files (work in progress)
├── 📁 Photos/            # Sample images for practice
└── 📁 Videos/            # Sample videos for practice
```

## Learning Progress

### 🔄 Currently Learning
- Basic OpenCV setup and fundamentals
- Image and video handling
- Following the FreeCodeCamp tutorial series

### 📋 Planned Topics
- [ ] Image filtering and transformations
- [ ] Color space conversions
- [ ] Edge detection
- [ ] Feature detection
- [ ] Object detection
- [ ] Face recognition
- [ ] Motion detection
- [ ] Machine learning with OpenCV

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (optional, for displaying images)

## Installation

```bash
# Install OpenCV
pip install opencv-python

# Install additional dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

The Python files in this repository demonstrate various OpenCV concepts as I work through the tutorial series. Each file focuses on specific functionality that I'm learning.

```bash
# Run any of the practice files
python <filename>.py
```

## Notes and Tips

💡 **Learning Notes**:
- Always check image paths and ensure files exist
- Remember that OpenCV uses BGR color format by default
- Practice with different image types and sizes
- Experiment with parameters to understand their effects

## Future Plans

- Add more advanced computer vision projects
- Implement real-time video processing
- Explore machine learning integration
- Create practical applications using learned concepts
