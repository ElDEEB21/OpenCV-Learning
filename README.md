## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (optional, for displaying images)

## Installation

```bash
# Install OpenCV
pip install opencv-python

# Install additional dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### FreeCodeCamp Course Materials (Completed)
The Python files in the `01-FreeCodeCamp-Course/src/` directory demonstrate various OpenCV concepts from the completed tutorial series. Each file focuses on specific functionality.

```bash
# Navigate to the FreeCodeCamp course directory
cd "01-FreeCodeCamp-Course/src"

# Run any of the practice files
python <filename>.py
```

### OpenCV University Course (Current)
As I progress through the OpenCV University course, new materials and projects will be organized in the `02-OpenCV-University/` directory.

## Notes and Tips

💡 **Learning Notes**:
- Always check image paths and ensure files exist
- Remember that OpenCV uses BGR color format by default
- Practice with different image types and sizes
- Experiment with parameters to understand their effects

## Future Plans

- ✅ ~~Complete FreeCodeCamp OpenCV fundamentals course~~
- 🔄 Progress through OpenCV University advanced course
- Add more sophisticated computer vision projects
- Implement real-time video processing applications
- Explore deep learning integration with OpenCV
- Create practical applications using learned concepts
- Build a portfolio of computer vision projects
